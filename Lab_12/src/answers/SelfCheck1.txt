we are showing that you can not add duplicates

1. creates a new set s
2. adds "hello" to set s
3. adds "bye" to set s
4. because all elements in s already exists in s

we are showing the subset method is not commutative.

5. creates a new set t
6. add "123" to set t
7. adds all elements of t to a that do not already exist in s
8. prints false because s is not a sub set of t
9. prints true because t is a sub set of s

shows that you have to add an element for the set to contain it

10. prints false because "ace" is not contained in s

If you call the retain all on the two sets on each other it means that the two sets contain the exact same elements

11. prints true because "123" is contained in s
12. because "123" is the only overlapping object from s and t all other elements are removed
13. prints true because s contains "123"
14. since "123" is the only shared element in t and s all other elements are removed
15.prints true because "123" is contained in t.
